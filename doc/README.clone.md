# Obtaining the software

The authoritative location of the software is the following git
repository:
   <https://git.mpeg.expert/MPEG/3dgh/v-pcc/software/mpeg-pcc-dmetric>

Each released version may be identified by a version control system tag in
the form `release-v0.14.2`.

An example:

```console
$ git clone https://git.mpeg.expert/MPEG/3dgh/v-pcc/software/mpeg-pcc-dmetric
$ cd mpeg-pcc-dmetric
```

> It is strongly advised to obtain the software using the version control
> system rather than to download a zip (or other archive) of a particular
> release.  The build system uses the version control system to accurately
> identify the version being built.
